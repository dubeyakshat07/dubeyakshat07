## üß† What I Do

* **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Developing interpretable models that enhance transparency and trustworthiness, particularly in healthcare settings. My research includes both model-agnostic and model-specific interpretability methods, supported by textual justifications to increase trust among domain experts and machine learning practitioners.

* **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: Exploring the intersection of AI and human interaction to improve user experiences. This involves creating intuitive interfaces and frameworks that facilitate seamless interaction between users and AI systems.

* **Visualization XAI Storytelling Framework**: Leveraging visualization techniques to build frameworks that tell compelling XAI stories. This approach combines multi-task distillation with interpretability techniques to enable audience-centric explainability models aimed at healthcare professionals and machine learning practitioners.

* **AI Regulations**: Addressing the ethical and regulatory aspects of AI to shape responsible advancements. My work includes developing a five-layer nested model for AI design and validation, which aims to streamline AI application design and validation, improving fairness, trust, and AI adoption.

* **Research Focus**: Currently delving into the intricacies of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in healthcare, focusing on increasing the trust of both domain experts and machine learning experts to enable responsible AI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Toolbox

* **TensorFlow & PyTorch**: Proficient in developing robust machine learning solutions using TensorFlow and leveraging PyTorch's flexibility and power for deep learning endeavors.

* **PyTorch Lightning**: Utilize PyTorch Lightning for seamless model development and prototyping, enabling unified code for GPU/TPU.

* **JAX**: Navigate the world of differentiable programming with JAX to build high-performance machine learning models.

* **Docker & Kubernetes**: Skilled in containerization with Docker and orchestrating scalable deployments using Kubernetes.

* **Flyte**: Streamline machine learning workflows with the power and flexibility of Flyte, a Python-based ML workflow orchestration tool.

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implement RAG techniques to enhance the performance of large language models by integrating external knowledge sources during generation.

* **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Apply LoRA for efficient fine-tuning of large language models, reducing computational resources while maintaining performance.

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Leverage MCP, an open standard developed by Anthropic, to standardize how applications provide context to LLMs. MCP enables seamless integration between AI models and external data sources, facilitating secure, two-way connections and enhancing the capabilities of AI-powered tools.&#x20;
